---- React is a new syntax that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.
---- JSX is not natively understood by browsers. 
---- Instead, it needs to be converted into valid JavaScript using tools like Babel. 
---- This process is known as transpilation.
---- It ensures that browsers can properly interpret and run the JSX code embedded within React applications.
