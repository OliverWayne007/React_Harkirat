1. First of all, the buttonComponentReRender() function is called to render the initial UI.

2. The buttonComponentReRender() function clears the existing UI and calls the buttonComponent() function 
   with the initial state as input.

3. The buttonComponent(state) function generates and returns the DOM element, given the state.

4. The state changes when the button is clicked.

5. To update the state on clicking the button, an event-listener is attached to the button to listen to the "onclick" event.

6. On-clicking the button, this "onButtonPress()" event-listener is fired to update the state and re-render the component, given the 
   updated state.

7. Inorder to reflect the state change on the UI, the component is re-rendered, given the updated state by invoking the
   buttonComponentReRender() function.
