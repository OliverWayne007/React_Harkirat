windows.location.href = "/somepath" results in kind of a hard-reload which results in fetching all the HTML, CSS and JS
from the server all over again, which defeats the purpose of a Single-Page-Application.

Therefore, we don't use windows.location.href = "/somepath", rather we use the useNavigate() hook provided by react-router-dom.

The useNavigate hook provided by react-router-dom can only be used from inside a component that is present inside the 
<BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter> component.

In the App.jsx file, we have used/invoked the useNavigate() hook from inside the <TopBar /> component which is in turn 
wrapped inside the <BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter /> component as shown below:

<BrowserRouter>
    <TopBar />
<BrowserRouter />
